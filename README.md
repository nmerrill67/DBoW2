The sole purpose of this fork is to write python wrappers for creating precision-recall curves

First download and install my fork of DLib. My fork is working for OpenCV 3.x and Ubuntu 18
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nmerrill67/DLib
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ make && sudo make install
```

To compile:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make 
```
